<h1>Looking for translators</h1>

<p>Colour names exist in every language (even in «J<span style="font-size: 80%;">AVA</span>(TM)»).
  The site <a href="http://colour.name">colour.name</a> is built, so that a translation in other
  languages is located in only a few places. It concerns about 15 to 20 pages - they are about the size of the
  page you are actually reading. 
  Alongside there exists a language-property file containing about 100 terms to translate.</p>
  
  
  <p>Of course it would be interesting, if the translator could nominate about 100 colours, so the
    database consists some interesting data right from the beginning.</p>

<p>Interested? Get in contact with me, so I can send you the pages, which are to be translated:
<?=$TPL_PATHS->intLink("kontakt"   , $TPL_LANG->getText('kontakt.link.name')     ); ?></p>

<?php include $TPL_PATHS->getServerRoot() . '/copyright.php'; ?>
