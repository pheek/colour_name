www.colour.name
---------------

This webpage tries to give each colour a specific name. 
Unfortunately names of colours (or "color" for our overseas friends)
can not be fixed to specific RGB-Values.
So this side tries to ask the community, what they see in RGB values.
All nominations together will give a great picture of colours.
